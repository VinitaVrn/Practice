    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is a branch of science concerned with the substances of which matter is composed, 
        the investigation of their properties and reactions, and the use of such reactions to form new substances.
        </p>
    <h2>Chemistry Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark> Periodic table </mark> is a tabular arrangemnet of chemical elements.
    Each element is represented by its chemical symbol such as <b>Fe</b> for iron, <b>H</b> for hydrogen,
    <b>O</b> for Oxygen. Elements are classified into groups or periods based on their properties.
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reaction are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>.
        here's an example of <i>chemical reaction</i>:
       <br/> 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O <br/>
       This equation represent the reaction between hydrogen gas (<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>) and Oxygen gas
       (<i>O<sub>2</sub></i>) to form water (<i>H<sub>2</sub>O</i>).
    </p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p><strong>Stiochiometry</strong> is a collection of reactants and products in chemical reactions.
        It involves balabcing chemical reation equation to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    <br/> <sub>Subsripts</sub> indicates the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while
    <sup>supercript</sup>represent charges or no. of atoms in an ion.
    
</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Chemistry play a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of air we breath
    to the reaction that power our bodies, chemistry influences evey aspect of our lives.
